# Pastel

> A hobby project: a tiny Pascal interpreter written in Go.

Pastel is inspired by _Standard Pascal: User Reference Manual_ by Doug Cooper (1983),  
and is being built slowly, one concept at a time, for learning, practice, and fun.

This is **not** a serious production tool — it's a joyful exploration project! I am
currently using it to explore whats possible with AI-assisted development.
